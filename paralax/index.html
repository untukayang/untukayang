        <h2>Things you should know</h2><br>
        <p>Since we have known each other for a year and more, i'm unquestionably glad we stumbled into each other. You might be bored with always listening to the same thing over and over again, but when i tell you i'm forever grateful that i met you, i mean it. The thing is, from the first time we had a conversation, i was completely head over heels for you. You probably don't believe it, but that's the truth. I fell for your voice when you were laughing, i fell for your point of view when we compared notes, and of course, i fell in love with your face, i'm not gonna lie, i chose you that time cause of those three things haha. But really, i chose you because you are you. Your personality and your talent. And then, you and i are getting closer. Little did you know that the more i learned about you, the more i fell in love with you. This might sound cringe, but i do adore you, love you. Being with you literally constantly boosts my mood. Like, i can be myself but also want to be the best version of myself. I literally fall in love with you. Everything you do is excellent, and i'm always proud to have you in my life. You know, you really taught me lots of things. And i'm very, really superly thank you for everything. I AM REALLY BEYOND THANK YOU  FOR LETTING ME BE A PART OF YOUR LIFE JOURNEY. And for that, too, i'm sorry, i'm sorry for my flaws. Sorry if i accidentally made you upset or mad with my act. Sorry for sometimes i was being stone-headed. I feel like i'm sorry for not being good enough. I want you to know that I'm so in love with you that i really wish you the best. I ask God to surround you with good things. I really hope you're always healthy there. Oh god, I want nothing but the perfect thing for you. At last, if i can't be the one who's always beside you to support you, know that my prayers silently will always do. I love you so much, i hope you are okay with it.</p>
